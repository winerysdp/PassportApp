# PassportApp
Nathan Milne 1/5/2018

Additions:
  PassNav now shows what I think the navigation should look like with a single Winery picture, Winery name and brief discription (maybe address instead?), and blank box which will be replaced by a stamp if the stamp has been collected.
  Moved buttons to bottom of screen
  Removed general notes section button
  WineryScreen now has the general layout it should have
  WineryScreen takes variables as input to render
  WineryScreen has new notes and stamp section
  
Needed:
  Write a seperate winery class? (for object oriented programming)
  Test PassNav image size on smaller phones
  Re-write PassNav to render based on passed variables or objects
  PassNav image clicking functionality
  Replace PassNav 'Winery Screen' button with home button
  Replace WineryScreen 'Next Winery' button with back button
  WineryScreen review button
  Review page
  WineryScreen image carousel (link to API in links page)
  WineryScreen Notes persistance and uniqueness (right now notes are the same for every winery)
  Edit no-stamp image to contain text 'Push to Scan Stamp' text
  Style Sheets
  Create home screen
